/**
 * Seller Service Metrics API
 *
 * The <i>Analytics API</i> provides data and information about a seller and their eBay business.  <br><br>The resources and methods in this API let sellers review information on their listing performance, metrics on their customer service performance, and details on their eBay seller performance rating.  <br><br>The three resources in the Analytics API provide the following data and information: <ul><li><b>Customer Service Metric</b> &ndash; Returns data on a seller's customer service performance as compared to other seller's in the same peer group.</li> <li><b>Traffic Report</b> &ndash; Returns data that shows how buyers are engaging with a seller's listings.</li> <li><b>Seller Standards Profile</b> &ndash; Returns data pertaining to a seller's performance rating.</li></ul> Sellers can use the data and information returned by the various Analytics API methods to determine where they can make improvements to increase sales and how they might improve their seller status as viewed by eBay buyers.  <br><br>For details on using this API, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/performance/analyzing-performance.html\" title=\"Selling Integration Guide\">Analyzing seller performance</a>.

Configure the following properties of the filter parameter to tune the traffic report to your needs: date_range Limits the report to the specified range of dates.

If the specified end date is beyond the lastUpdatedDate, eBay returns data up to the lastUpdatedDate. Required: Always listing_ids This filter limits the results to only the supplied list of listingId values. You can specify to 200 different listingId values. Enclose the list of IDs with curly braces (&amp;quot;{ }&amp;quot;), and separate multiple values with a pipe character (&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;).

All listings must be the seller&#39;s and they must be listed on the marketplace specified by the marketplace_ids filter argument. marketplace_ids This filter limits the report to seller data related to only the specified marketplace ID (currently the filter allows only a single marketplace ID).

Valid values: EBAY_AU EBAY_DE EBAY_GB EBAY_US EBAY_MOTORS Required if you set the dimension parameter to DAY. traffic_source Limits the report to either Promoted Listings items or non-Promoted Listings (organic) items. Valid values are ORGANIC and PROMOTED_LISTINGS. Enclose the list of values with curly braces (&amp;quot;{ }&amp;quot;), and separate multiple values with a pipe character (&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;) The default is both values.

     * @param  string $dimension This query parameter specifies the dimension, or &amp;quot;attribute,&amp;quot; that is applied to the report metric. Valid values: DAY or LISTING Examples If you specify dimension&#x3D;DAY and metric&#x3D;CLICK_THROUGH_RATE, the traffic report contains the number of times an item displayed on a search results page and the buyer clicked through to the View Item page for each day in the date range, as in: 12-06-17: 32, 12-07-17: 54, ... If you specify dimension&#x3D;LISTING and metric&#x3D;LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE, the traffic report contains the number of times that listing appeared on the seller&#39;s store during the specified date range. For example, LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE: 157 means the item appeared 157 times in the store during the date range. (optional)
     * @param  string $filter This query parameter refines the information returned in the traffic report. Configure the following properties of the filter parameter to tune the traffic report to your needs: date_range Limits the report to the specified range of dates. Format the date range by enclosing the earliest date and end date for the report in brackets (&amp;quot;[ ]&amp;quot;), as follows: [YYYYMMDD..YYYYMMDD] The maximum range between the start and end dates is 90 days, and the earliest start date you can specify is two years prior to the current date, which is defined as 730 days (365 * 2), not accounting for Leap Year. The last date for which traffic data exists is a value called lastUpdatedDate. eBay returns an error if you specify a date range greater than 90 days, or the start date is after the lastUpdatedDate. If the specified end date is beyond the lastUpdatedDate, eBay returns data up to the lastUpdatedDate. Required: Always listing_ids This filter limits the results to only the supplied list of listingId values. You can specify to 200 different listingId values. Enclose the list of IDs with curly braces (&amp;quot;{ }&amp;quot;), and separate multiple values with a pipe character (&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;). This filter only returns data for listings that have been either active or sold in last 90 days, and any unsold listings in the last 30 days. All listings must be the seller&#39;s and they must be listed on the marketplace specified by the marketplace_ids filter argument. marketplace_ids This filter limits the report to seller data related to only the specified marketplace ID (currently the filter allows only a single marketplace ID). Enclose the marketplace ID in curly braces (&amp;quot;{ }&amp;quot;). Valid values: EBAY_AU EBAY_DE EBAY_GB EBAY_US EBAY_MOTORS Required if you set the dimension parameter to DAY. traffic_source Limits the report to either Promoted Listings items or non-Promoted Listings (organic) items. Valid values are ORGANIC and PROMOTED_LISTINGS. Enclose the list of values with curly braces (&amp;quot;{ }&amp;quot;), and separate multiple values with a pipe character (&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;) The default is both values. Example filter parameter The following example shows how to configure the filter parameter with the marketplace_ids and date_range filters: filter&#x3D;marketplace_ids:{EBAY_US},date_range:[20170601..20170828] Note: You must URL encode all the values you supply in the filter parameter, as described in URL parameters.
